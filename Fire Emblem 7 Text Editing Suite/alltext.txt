But I'm just a rough[NL]

[NL]

[NL]
[TargCloseLeft][Ctrl 0x0017][NL]
...Rebecca,[Ctrl 0x0005] manners and carriage[NL]
alone do not make one a lady.[K]
[NL]
Certainly, I had to learn[NL]
the ways of the court...[K]
[NL]
But my husband,[Ctrl 0x0005] Lord Pent,[NL]
did not marry me for those.[K]
[Ctrl 0x0017][NL]
[TargCloseRight][NL]
Do you mean that?[K]
[NL]
[TargCloseLeft][Ctrl 0x0017][NL]
Haha...[Ctrl 0x0005] I do! I was 14...[K]

about your age now, I believe?[K]
[NL]
Count Reglay had gathered as[NL]

[Ctrl 0x0017][NL]
[TargCloseRight][NL]
Twenty women!?[K]
[NL]
[TargCloseLeft][Ctrl 0x0017][NL]
Before Lord Pent would see them,[NL]
each had to exhibit a special skill.[K]
[NL]
Everyone was eager to demonstrate[NL]
the qualities of a good wife...[K]
[NL]
And...[Ctrl 0x0005]I was one of those women[NL]
trying so hard to impress him.[K]
[NL]
They were all highborn[NL]
ladies of Etruria.[K]
[NL]
They sang, danced, played music,[NL]
and composed poetry...[K]
[NL]
And I could not have outdone[NL]
them in any of those arts...[K]
[Ctrl 0x0017][NL]
[TargCloseRight][NL]
So...then...how did he come[NL]
to choose you?[K]
[NL]
[TargCloseLeft][Ctrl 0x0017][NL]
...I said to Lord Pent,[NL]
"My skill is with the bow."[K]
[NL]
And then...[K]
[NL]
"My sweet lord, if you choose me,[NL]
I will protect you to life's end."[K]
[Ctrl 0x0017][NL]
[TargCloseRight][NL]
No...way![K]
[NL]
[TargCloseLeft][Ctrl 0x0017][NL]
My face was flushed after I spoke,[K]
[NL]
and the room filled with laughter.[K]
[NL]
...I could feel their scorn,[Ctrl 0x0005][NL]
as if to say "foolish girl!"[K]
[NL]
But one of them...smiled.[K]
[NL]
And he looked down at me[NL]
with the kindest eyes...[K]
[Ctrl 0x0002][NL]
It was...Lord Pent.[K]
[NL]
[TargCloseRight][NL]
[Ctrl 0x0016]......[Ctrl 0x0016][K]
[NL]
[TargCloseLeft][NL]
"I have never met a girl whose[NL]
heart was so clear, Louise,"[K]
[NL]
he said, and he then took my hand.[K]
[NL]
...I felt like I was being[NL]
lifted into heaven...[K]
[Ctrl 0x0015][Ctrl 0x0006][NL]
So, dear Rebecca...[Ctrl 0x0005][NL]
Instead of doubting yourself...[K]
[NL]
Show the one you love[NL]
your true heart.[K]
[Ctrl 0x0002][NL]
Don't underestimate yourself.[K]

When Nergal first created[NL]

[NL]
He had one assistant.[K]
[Ctrl 0x0002][NL]
A mercenary who wanted[NL]

[NL]
a friend he had lost in battle.[K]

This mercenary volunteered[NL]

I can certainly understand[NL]

[NL]
to disobey your lord is[NL]
unthinkable for a knight...[K]

But what would you have done?[K]

as level 20[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021].[K]
[Ctrl 0x0002][NL]

Let me give you a brief[NL]
explanation of magic.[Ctrl 0x0005][NL]
Magic can be divided into[NL]
three large groups.[K]
[Ctrl 0x0002][NL]
[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]Anima[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021] magic is[NL]
based on nature. Its attacks[NL]
include Fire and Thunder.[K]
[Ctrl 0x0002][NL]
The basic attack of [Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]Light[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021][NL]
is Lightning,[Ctrl 0x0005] while [Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]Dark[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021][NL]
magic uses a spell called Flux.[K]
[Ctrl 0x0002][NL]
Each type of magic has an[NL]
affinity for other types of[NL]
magic, similar to the[NL]
weapons triangle.[K]
[Ctrl 0x0002][NL]
[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]Light[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021] is [Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]strong vs. dark[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021],[NL]
[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]dark[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021] is [Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]strong vs. anima[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021], and[NL]
[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]anima[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021] is [Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]strong vs. light[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021].[Ctrl 0x0005][NL]
This is the [Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]Trinity of Magic[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021].[K]
[Ctrl 0x0002][NL]
So, a monk's [Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]light magic[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021] is[NL]
[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]strong[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021] against a shaman's[NL]
[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]dark magic[Ctrl 0x0080][Ctrl 0x0021]. Remember[NL]

The Black Fang is a guild of[NL]
assassins founded about ten[K]
[NL]
years ago by Brendan Reed.[NL]
They're based in Bern.[K]
[NL]
Their arms reached quickly[NL]
in several other countries.[K]
[NL]
Originally, they targeted only[NL]
nobles who abused their positions.[K]
[NL]
The masses saw them as chivalrous,[NL]
defenders of the common man.[K]
[NL]
Their activities found[NL]
wide support.[K]
[NL]
[Ctrl 0x001C][TargFarLeft][NL]
Chivalrous...[K]
[Ctrl 0x001C][NL]
[TargCloseLeft][NL]
Then about a year ago, Brendan[NL]
got married again.[K]
[NL]
Black Fang's operations have[NL]
slowly changed since then.[K]
[NL]
Now, they'll take on any[NL]
target, no matter how difficult,[K]
[NL]
as long as they're paid.[K]
[NL]
And they're no longer killing only[NL]
criminals; anyone is a fair target.[K]

[NL]
Nergal's trusted retainer Ephidel[NL]
is with Marquess Laus.[K]
[NL]
He manipulated Laus into hatching[NL]
the rebellion plot against Ostia.[K]

Impressive, Oswin.[NL]

[TargMediRight][NL]

Bramimond had to break the seal[NL]

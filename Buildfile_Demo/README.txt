HOW TO USE:

This is a sample project folder that contains examples of how to install just about anything using buildfiles and Event Assembler.
Simply place a clean FE8 (U) rom into the Buildfile_Demo folder and name it "fe8_clean.gba", then run MAKE HACK.cmd
This will create FE_Hack.gba and FE_Hack.ups in your folder.

Feel free to poke around the project folders if you like. Event files can be treated just like txt files.

I must thank you all for the help.[A][NL]
Thus,[.] I have decided to follow you![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Don't feel too indebted to us.[A][2NL]
Those bandits were hardly a challenge[NL]
anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Perhaps not for the likes of you,[.][NL]
but I was beginning to evaluate my[NL]
life's regrets![A][2NL]
I must let my Mistress know of your[NL]
heroic efforts![A][2NL]
You shall receive her blessing![A]
[OpenLeft]
Your Mistress...[....] Sofia,[.] you said?[.] [A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes![.] I've been looking for my Mistress[NL]
ever since I was displaced from her.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Displaced?[.] Wait a moment...[....] Sofia?[A][2NL]
Are you talking about the Princess[NL]
of Marsene?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That is correct![.] I am looking for the[NL]
Princess.[A][2NL]
Ah...[....] she must be worried sick that one[NL]
of her precious retainers is lost,[.] again.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Again?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Ha ha ha![.] You must be joking![.] You...!?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh,[.] but you must believe me![.][NL]
I've been appointed by her directly![A][2NL]
She must be quite worried about me![A]
[OpenLeft]
This doesn't sound weird to me considering[NL]
the last few days...[A][2NL]
I believe him![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'm afraid you both misunderstand me.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Pardon?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I do believe him,[.] as his sense of duty is[NL]
very apparent...[....] Almost overwhelming,[.] even.[A][2NL]
I don't deny that he's affiliated with the[NL]
Princess...[....] it's just that...[A][2NL]
Is this a regular occurrence for the[NL]
royal staff?[A][2NL]
A retainer's lost...[....] "Again"?[MoveFarLeft] Hee hee hee.[A]
[OpenLeft]
...[....][NL]
You can't be serious,[.] father![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Hee hee.[.] Sorry.[A][2NL]
*Cough*[MoveFarLeft] *Cough*[MoveFarLeft] What I meant to say was:[.][NL]
*Ahem* We would love to have you[A][NL]
travel with us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Uh...[....] Thank you,[.] sir...?[....][A][2NL]
*Ahem* I believe a proper introduction[NL]
is in order.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I am Lloyd and this is my father,[.] Silvester.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Nice to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Likewise![.] I am Roger of Marsene's army[NL]
and one of Princess Sofia's retainers.[A][2NL]
...![....][NL]
Hmmmm...[....][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Is something wrong,[.] Roger?[.] Why are you[NL]
staring at me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...[....] Silvester?[.][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Aye.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I recognise that name from somewhere...[A][2NL]
You are one of the previous generals[NL]
of Nihil![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Ha![.] I guess my cover is blown,[.] eh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...![MoveFarRight][....]W-[.] why would someone like you[MoveFarRight] be so[NL]
deep in Marsene!?[MoveFarRight][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Don't worry about me![NL]
My ties with Nihil have been broken for[NL]
quite some time![A][2NL]
I can't go back![A][2NL]
Just ask my son.[.] We live here now![A]
[OpenLeft]
As a matter of fact,[.] we are currently being[NL]
chased down by Nihil's forces as we speak![A][2NL]
We must flee to Sehrar as soon as[NL]
possible![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
*Whisper* We would have made impeccable[NL]
timing had we snuck by the trees...[A]
[OpenLeft]
*Whisper* Father!!![MoveLeft][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh my![MoveMidRight][.] Marsene is in danger![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Yes.[.] The road back to the capital through[NL]
Marsene is risky.[A][2NL]
It would be wise to take an alternative[NL]
route.[A]
[OpenLeft]
*Whisper* Perhaps by the trees,[.] Father[MoveLeft]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah...[....] it is a pity,[.] but it seems Sofia[NL]
must manage my absence even longer...[A]
[OpenLeft]
Off we go,[.] then![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Let us make haste[NL]
before those Nihilians catch up...[A]

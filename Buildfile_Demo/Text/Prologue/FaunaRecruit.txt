[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01]Wait up![A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x5][0x01]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]I recognise you from somewhere...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A][2NL]
I think you are mistaken,[.] then.[A][NL][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey wait![A][NL]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x5][0x01]I don't have time for this![A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x5][0x01]Did you see what those creeps did[NL]
to our town?[A][NL]
I have to escape or I- [A][NL]
I'll be killed too![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not think that is a[NL]
good solution,[.] though-[NL]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x5][0x01][MoveMidRight]What are you talking about![A][2NL]
They are trained soldiers,[.][NL]
I couldn't fight them evenly...[A]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Not with that attitude![A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x01]But,[.] you are correct about[NL]
one thing.[A][NL]
You could not fight them alone,[.][NL]
that I can see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But with us on your side it won't[NL]
be a problem,[.] right Father?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]If we join forces, it should[NL]
be a simple task.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've seen you in town before,[NL]
with your... thieving.[A][2NL]
You are fast,[.][NL]
but we are surrounded,[.] so it wont help.[A][2NL]
We have to fight our way out![A]
[OpenMidRight]
S-[.] surrounded?[A][2NL]
This is bad,[.] this is bad![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Calm down![.] We wont be able to[NL]
get out of this unless we are calm[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You are right...[A][2NL]
At this moment the only way[NL]
to escape is with force.[A][2NL]
I-[.] I will follow you.[A][2NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't worry we will get out[NL]
of this.[A][2NL]
But enough talk,[.] time to fight![A]

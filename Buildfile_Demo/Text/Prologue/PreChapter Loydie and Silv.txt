this time![A]
[OpenFarRight]
Loydie, I would never hold back on you,[NL]
I've been giving you my all every time.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Of course father, but it seems like[NL]
you haven't been trying very hard[A][NL]
against me...[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]
I have not been holding you back[NL]
during your training.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
But you have been holding back on me![A][NL]
Like that one time where you started[NL]
dozing off and proceeded to fight with[A][NL]
your eyes closed.[A][NL]
[OpenRight]
Ridiculous! I would never be distracted[NL]
in battle.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]

little handicap? I wont even move BWA HA[A][NL]
HA HA!"[A]
[OpenRight]
Hey! I don't sound anything like that![A]
[OpenLeft]
Or that time you used a broom to fight me?[A]
[OpenRight]
Oh yes, I remember that![A][NL]
That was priceless ha ha![A]
[OpenLeft]
Or that time when-[NL]
[OpenRight]
OK, OK, OK. I get it.[A][NL]
Battle is something to take seriously.[A][NL]
And since you are improving, I will fight[NL]
you as if you were trying to kill me.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Yes, but I hope you are serious about that![A]
[OpenRight]
But remember that means that I will be[NL]
trying to kill you too.[A]
[OpenLeft]
*Gulp* O- Okay...[A]
[OpenRight]
And *yawn* don't try to bore me to[NL]
death, OK?[A]

Hey! I knew you were lying![A][NL]

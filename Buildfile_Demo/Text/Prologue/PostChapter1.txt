What is going on?[A][2NL]
That man mentioned that the[NL]
emperor of Nihil wanted me?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
N-[.] Nihil,[.] that's one[NL]
of the most powerful countries[A][NL]
in the whole continent![A][2NL]
Why would a country even more powerful[NL]
than Marsene want Lloyd?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I have no idea why,[.] but one thing[NL]
is clear![A][2NL]
You are in grave danger Lloyd![A]
[OpenRight]
H-[.] how are we going to get[NL]
away from such a powerful country![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't worry son,[.] we will find[NL]
a way out of this![A][2NL]
I wont let those bastards take[NL]
you away![A]
[OpenRight]
F-[.][MoveRight][CloseEyes] father![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey now,[.] don't get misty eyed[NL]
on me.[Wink][A]
[OpenRight]
[OpenEyes]Y- yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The emperor of Nihil is a[NL]
powerful figure: politically[A][NL]
and in combat.[A][2NL]
This won't be easy,[.] so we[NL]
all require your strength.[A]
[OpenRight]
Of course![.] We will make[NL]
it out of this somehow![A]
[OpenFarRight]
I will support you guys from[NL]
now on.[A][2NL]
I may have pilfered from those[NL]
in town,[.] but after I saw the[A][NL]
fear in those town folk's eyes[NL]
I can't let that happen to you two.[A][2NL]
Plus I owe you two a debt,[.] for you[NL]
helping me against those soldiers.[A]
[OpenRight]
We would be glad to accept your help[NL]
Fauna.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Oh![.] I almost forgot.[.] here I...[....][NL]
kinda stole this from Lloyd.[A]
[OpenRight]
T-[.] this is, my pendant![A]
[OpenFarRight]
Heh heh heh. Yea... sorry[A]
[OpenRight]
This was given to me by my mother[NL]
before she died,[.] when I was a baby.[A][2NL]
Thank you Fauna this pendant means[NL]
a lot to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We better start moving![A][2NL]
The emperor would not send only one squadron[NL]
of men,[.] after someone he desires greatly.[A][2NL]
We shall escape to Sehrar.[A][2NL]
I know of a eastward path through the[NL]
mountains.[A][2NL]
It will bring us to a cave that goes right[NL]
under the massive mountain range splitting[A][NL]
the two countries.[A]
[OpenRight]
Right then,[.] let's go![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]
I hope this goes smoothly.[A]

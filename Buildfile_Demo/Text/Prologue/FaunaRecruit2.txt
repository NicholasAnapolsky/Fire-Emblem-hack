[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x01]But,[.] you are correct about[NL]
one thing.[A][NL]
You could not fight them alone,[.][NL]
that I can see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But with us on your side it won't[NL]
be a problem,[.] right Father?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]If we join forces, it should[NL]
be a simple task.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've seen you in town before,[NL]
with your... thieving.[A][NL]
You are fast,[.][NL]
but even with that it wont help.[A][2NL]
Because we are surrounded.[A][2NL]
So we have to fight our[NL]
way out![A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
S-[.] surrounded?[A][2NL]

of this.[A][2NL]
But enough talk time to fight![A][NL]

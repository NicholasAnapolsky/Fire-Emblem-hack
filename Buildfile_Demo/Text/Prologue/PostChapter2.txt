What is going on?[A][2NL]
That man mentioned that the[NL]
emperor of Nihil wanted me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I have no idea why,[.] but one thing[NL]
is clear![A][2NL]
You are in grave danger Lloyd![A]
[OpenRight]
H-[.] how are we going to get[NL]
away from such a powerful country![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't worry son,[.] we will find[NL]
a way out of this![A][2NL]
I won't let those bastards take[NL]
you away![A]
[OpenRight]
F-[.][MoveRight][CloseEyes] father![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey now,[.] don't get misty eyed[NL]
on me.[Wink][A]
[OpenRight]
[OpenEyes]Y- yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The emperor of Nihil is a[NL]
powerful figure: politically[A][NL]
and in combat.[A][2NL]
This won't be easy,[.] so we[NL]
all require your strength.[A]
[OpenRight]
Of course![.] We will make[NL]
it out of this somehow![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I almost forgot, Lloyd.[A][2NL]
I found your pendant laying on the ground.[A][2NL]
I know it's very important to you.[.] So I took[NL]
good care of it.[A][2NL]
Brings back memories of your mother...[A][2NL]
I remmeber the day she gave that[NL]
pendant to you.[A][NL]
The day she passed away...[A]
[OpenRight]
[CloseEyes]Father,[.] thank you...[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
But it's not the time to reminisce.[.] We better[NL]
start moving![A][2NL]
The emperor would not send only one squadron[NL]
of men after someone he desires greatly.[A][2NL]
We shall escape to Sehrar.[A][2NL]
I know of an eastward path through the[NL]
mountains.[A][2NL]
It will bring us to a cave that goes right[NL]
under the massive mountain range splitting[A][NL]
the two countries.[A]
[OpenRight]
Right then,[.] let's go![A]

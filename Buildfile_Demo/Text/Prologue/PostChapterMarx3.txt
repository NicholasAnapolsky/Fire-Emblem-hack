[ToggleSmile]WAH HA HA HA![A][2NL]
How does it feel Lloyd? Silvester?[ToggleSmile][A][2NL]
If you two have not fled for your life,[.][NL]
your home would still be flourishing.[A][2NL]
But I am not satisfied![ToggleSmile][A][2NL]
Killing Lloyd will bring me the closure I[NL]
require.[A][2NL]
Heh heh heh![ToggleSmile][.] I know it was you[NL]
Silvester, the one who allowed him to escape.[A][2NL]
You've been a true nuisance to me,[.][NL]
on every level.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]The man I hired will kill you soon,[.] that I can assure.[A][2NL]
And after you are out of my way[....].[....].[....].[A][2NL]
Lloyd will be at my mercy![A][2NL]
AH HA HA HA![A][2NL]
So,[.] enjoy your travel for now as your[NL]
final destination is death![ToggleSmile][A]

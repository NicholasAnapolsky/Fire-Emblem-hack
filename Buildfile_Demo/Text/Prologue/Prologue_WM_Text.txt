Many years ago, in the shadowy past...[A][2NL] 
In the beginning, Fire Emblem hacking was[N]
a difficult and dangerous endeavour,[AN]
filled with shoddy reskins and edgy[N]
self-insert teenage swordmasters.[AN]
In those dark days, even the most basic[N]
tasks proved tedious and intimidating.[A][2NL] 
In time, tools were developed to ease[N]
the burden for aspiring hackers.[AN]
Chief among these new and shiny tools was[N]
FEditor, making hacking "idiot proof".[AN]
However, FEditor began to grow mad with[N]
power, breaking roms left and right while[AN]
insisting it knew better than the user.[N]
As FEditor stagnated, so did the [AN]
ROM hacking community as a whole.[A][2NL] 
Until now...[AN][X]

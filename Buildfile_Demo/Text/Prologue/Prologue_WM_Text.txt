So for everyone reading this,[A][NL]
thank you for taking your time[N]
by playing this thing :).[AN]
Unfortunately this isn't an epic opening[N]
with plenty of lore and history.[AN]
To tell the truth I have not written it yet,[NL]
sorry. Forgive me![AN]
Anyway, we start with Loydie and his father[AN]
training near their forest bound[N]
house. Until something goes wrong...[AN]
